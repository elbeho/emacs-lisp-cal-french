=head1 Presentation

This repository is  a very partial fork of Emacs.   Only one code file
has  been  kept,  F<cal-french.el>,   the  code  for  converting  from
Gregorian to French Revolutionary or the other way.

=head1 Installation

If Emacs is not running, copy F<cal-french.el> to
F</path/to/emacs/site-lisp>, start Emacs. That's all.

If Emacs is running, copy F<cal-french.el> to
F</path/to/emacs/site-lisp>, and then

  M-x load-file /path/to/emacs/site-lisp/cal-french.el

If F</path/to/emacs/site-lisp> is displayed  in a C<dired> buffer, you
can use the line-command C<L>.

=head1 Usage

Similar to the old  version of C<cal-french.el>.  Open the (Gregorian)
calendar with

  M-x calendar

Then, go to any date of your choice and type C<p f>, this will display
the French Revolutionary date of  the current day. C<p o> will display
the current day in all the calendars known to Emacs.

Alternately,  you  can   go  to  a  day  if   you  know  which  French
Revolutionary date it  is associated with. Type C<g  f> and Emacs asks
you:

=over 4

=item * the year,

=item * the month (Vendémiaire, Nivôse, etc) or a feast (Jour des récompenses)

=item * the day number (except if you gave a feast at the previous question).

=head1 Changes

=head2 Day Name

Instead  of just  displaying  "18  Brumaire an  8  de la  Révolution",
F<cal-french.el>  now  displays  "Octidi   18  Brumaire  an  8  de  la
Révolution".

Not available yet.

=head2 Additional Days

Displaying "Jour  du Travail de l'année  222 de la  Révolution" is not
very convenient, you cannot guess  whether this day is before or after
"Jour du Génie de l'année 222 de la Révolution".  This changes gives a
number in the 1-to-5 range (or 1-to-6 on leap years).  Additionally, I
found in a  book from the French Revolution era  that these years bear
the   same  names   as  the   other:  "Primidi",   "Duodi"   etc.   So
F<cal-french.el> will display:

   "Duodi 2 jour complémentaire an 222 de la Révolution, Jour du Génie"

   "Tridi 3 jour complémentaire an 222 de la Révolution, Jour du Travail"

In  addition,  when  using  C<g   f>,  you  can  now  reply  with  the
pseudo-month "jour complémentaire", and then a number in the 1-to-5 or
1-to-6 range.

Not available yet.

=head1 Feasts

Actually, not  only the 5 or  6 end-of-year additional  days, but also
the 360 normal days had  a feast. So C<cal-french.el> will display the
feast for all days, for example:

  "Primidi 1 Vendémiaire an  223 de la Révolution, Jour du Raisin"

Of course, all feasts are available when answering to C<g f>.

Since this  repository is some kind  of fork of Emacs,  the license is
the same, that is, GPL v3 or an higher version.
